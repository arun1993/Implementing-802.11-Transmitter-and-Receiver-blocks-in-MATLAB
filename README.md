# mplementing-a-basic-802.11-mod-ulation-demodulation-and-packet-processing-system
In this repo, an  OFDM communication system is realized using Matlab. The system represents a simplified version of the WiFi (802.11) PHY layer, which involves packet construction at the transmitter side, and packet detection, synchronization and decoding at the receiver side.
