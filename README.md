# Implementing-a-basic-802.11-mod-ulation-demodulation-and-packet-processing-system
In this repo, an  OFDM communication system is realized using Matlab. The system represents a simplified version of the WiFi (802.11) PHY layer, which involves packet construction at the transmitter side, and packet detection, synchronization and decoding at the receiver side. 

1) Packet construction and OFDM modulation.
Step  (a)
BPSK  modulation: 
Create  a  packet  represented  by  a  vector  of  random
bits
{0,1,1,0,1...}. The 
vector
should contain 4160 bi
ts.
C
onvert the digital b
its into BPSK symbols
(1+0*j or 
-
1+0*j)
, and then 
group  the  BPSK  symbols  into  802.11  OFDM  symbols. 
W
e 
already 
discussed  about 
the  structure  of  one 
OFDM  symbol  in  802.11
in  lecture  4  and  lecture  5
.  For  the  4  pilo
ts  in  each  OFDM  symb
ol,  you  can 
assume all of them are 
fixed to 
1+0*j.
Step  (b)
OFDM  modulation:  modulate  each  OFDM  symbol  using  64
-
point  IFFT,  and  add  a  16
-
sample 
cyclic prefix to it.

Step  (c)
Add  STF  and  LTF  preambles  to  each  data  pac
ket,  follow
ing  Sec.  17.3.3 of  IEEE 802.11
-
2007. 
Note  that  both  preambles  are  a  sequence  of  complex  numbers  in  fr
equency  domain,  and 
should  be 
converted to time domain using IFFT, similar to the data symbols.
Step (c)
Plot the magnitude of samples in the re
su
lting STF. Also, plot the power 
spectrum density of the 
OFDM  data  symbols.  802.11  uses  64  frequency
bins  (subcarriers)  for 
each  OFDM  symbol.  So  when 
plotting the spectrum, you should use 64
-
point FFT.

(2) Packet transmission and channel distortion
After
the above steps
, 
the 
packet is modulated into a sequenc
e of 
samples (complex numbers). Now, 
add a 
number  of  (e.g,.  100)  zero  samples
before  the  packet,
to  re
present  the  idle  period  before  the  actual 
transmission  happens
. 
Suppose
the  packet 
is  sent 
through  a  simpli
fied  wireless  channel,  with  the 
following disto
rtion effects:
(i)
Magnitude distortion: the channel attenuates the magnitude of each sample to 10^
-
5 of 
the original
(ii)
The channel shifts the phase of each sample by 
-
3pi/4, i.e., multiplying it by exp(
-
j*3pi/4)
(iii)
The imperfect radio hardware causes a 
frequency
offset 
between transmitter and receiver. 
This offset causes the receiver's phase to drift from the transmitter's phase. Suppose the 
phase drift is exp(
-
j*2*pi*0.00017) per sample, i.e., for the k
-
th sample, the phase drift is 
exp(
-
j*2*pi*0.00017*k)
(iv)
Add 
ch
annel 
noise. For each sample, add a Gaussian random number (mean 0 and 
variance
10^
-
7) to represent 
channel 
noise.
Plot
the magnitude of samples in the packetâ€™s
STF, after the channel distortion effect
s
.
(3) Packet detection
The channel
-
distorted samples 
are what the receiver actually receives. But the receiver actually
needs the 
packets  and  the  bits  therein.  So  how  does  a  receiver  k
now  a  packet  arrives?  Recall  in 
lecture  5
we 
discussed  about  using  self
-
correlation  algorithm  to  detect  the  presence  of  the  S
TF,
thus  iden
tifying  the 
arrival  of  a  packet
.
Now,  implement  the  self
-
correlation  based  algorithm  to  d
etect  packets.  Test  your 
packet 
detection  algorithm  using  the  channel
-
distorted  sequence  of  samples  as 
input.  Plot  the  self
-
correlation 
results  as  a  funct
ion  of  sample  index. 
Write  down 
the  indexes  of  the  samples  where  packets
are detected.
(4) 
Packet synchronization
Packet detection does not tell us the exact starting time of a packet. But since the STF sequence is known 
to  the  receiver,  a  cross
-
correlat
ion  algorithm  can  be  used  to  single  out  the  first  sample  of  the  STF,  thus 
achieving  synchronization  between  receiver  and  transmitter. 
Now, 
implement  the  cross
-
correlation 
algorithm  for  synchronization,  again  using  the  channel
distorted  sequence  of  samples 
as  input.  Plot  the 
cross
-
correlation results, as a function of s
ample index. Print the indices
of samples corresponding to the 
STF starting time, for each packet.

Channel estimation and packet decoding
Ref: Chapter 6 of this MS thesis

.unh.edu/services/testing/wireless/knowledgebase/theses/Surineni_SDR_Implementation_
of_802.11_Baseband.pdf
Step  (a)
After  synchronization,  the  receiver  knows  the  exact  starting  time  of  the  LTF  as  well.  Now, 
leverage  the  LTF  to  estimate  the  frequency  offse
t  between  the  transmitter  and  receiver,  and  print  the 
result.
Step  (b)
The  receiver  knows  the  sequence  of  samples  in  LTF,  so  it  can  estimate  the  channel 
magnitude/phase  distortion  to  each  sample  (corresponding  to  each  subcarrier  in  an  OFDM  symbol). 
Implem
ent the estimation algorithm. Print the channel distortion to each subcarrier.
Step (c) 
Now, decode the digital information in each OFDM data symbol. First, as the receiver knows the 
starting time of each OFDM data symbol, it can run FFT over each OFDM sy
mbol and convert it into a 
number  of  (64)  subcarriers.  Then,  it  can  recover  the  original  BPSK  symbols  by  reverting  the  channel 
distortion (We assume the channel is stable over an entire packet. So the OFDM symbols suffer from the 
same  channel  distortion  as
the  LTF).  Finally,  it  can demap  the  BPSK  symbols  to  {0,1}  information  bits 
and  convert  the  bits  into  characters.  Now  the  receiver  fully  recovers  the 
sequence  of  bits
sent  by  the 
transmitter!  Print  out  the  resulting  characters
and  check  if  they  are  the  sam
e  as  what  was  sent  by  the 
transmitter
.
