# Implementing-a-basic-802.11-mod-ulation-demodulation-and-packet-processing-system
In this repo, an  OFDM communication system is realized using Matlab. The system represents a simplified version of the WiFi (802.11) PHY layer, which involves packet construction at the transmitter side, and packet detection, synchronization and decoding at the receiver side. 

# (1) Packet construction and OFDM modulation.
Step  (a) BPSK  modulation: 
Step  (b) OFDM  modulation:  
Step  (c) Add  STF  and  LTF  preambles  to  each  data  packet
Step (d) Plot the magnitude of samples in the resulting STF. 

# (2) Packet transmission and channel distortion

# (3) Packet detection

# (4) Packet synchronization

# (5) Channel estimation and packet decoding
